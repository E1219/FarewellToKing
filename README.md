Farewell To King is a reusable, lightweight chess library written in C.  

It can be used to represent a game, to check move legality, and to perform other common chess related tasks for use in different chess applications.  There is a optional chess strings library that provides utilities to represent a game in ASCII and to parse moves from text.
